Go Toolbelt
===========

This is a collection of packages I use to augment the Go standard library.

- [assert](https://github.com/shabbyrobe/golib/tree/master/assert) - Very simple assertions
  for testing.

- [errtools](https://github.com/shabbyrobe/golib/tree/master/errtools) - I'm a fan of errors
  in Go, but even with go.uber.org/multierror and github.com/pkg/errors, they're incomplete.

All code is available under the MIT license or equivalent.
