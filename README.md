Go Toolbelt
===========

This is a collection of Go modules I use to augment the Go standard library in
my own personal projects.

All code is available under the MIT license unless otherwise stated in the
particular file or package.


## Expectation Management

This is a grab-bag of utility code that I add to in a very ad-hoc fashion.
*No API stability guarantees are made* and the code is *not guaranteed to work*.
Having said that, there are some extremely useful things in here that are
reasonably well tested, and you may get some use out of them.

I recommend you copy-paste pieces as-needed (including tests and
license/attribution) into the `internal/` folder of your projects rather than
reference these modules directly as I may change the APIs in here without
warning at any time.
