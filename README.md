Go Toolbelt
===========

This is a collection of Go modules I use to augment the Go standard library in
my own personal projects. There's some useful bits and pieces in here, but there's
also a lot of half-baked stuff and things can be very under-tested. Some parts of
this have not been used in a very long time and it could stand a bit of spring
cleaning.

Having said that, there are also some very handy nuggets in here.

All code is available under the MIT license unless otherwise stated in the
particular file or package.


## Expectation Management

This is a grab-bag of utility code that I add to in a very ad-hoc fashion.
*No API stability guarantees are made* and the code is *not guaranteed to work*.
Having said that, there are some extremely useful things in here that are
reasonably well tested, and you may get some use out of them.

I recommend you copy-paste pieces as-needed (including tests and
license/attribution) into the `internal/` folder of your projects rather than
reference these modules directly as I may change the APIs in here without
warning at any time.
