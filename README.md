Go Toolbelt
===========

This is a collection of Go modules I use to augment the Go standard library in
my own personal projects. Please read the section titled "Expectation
Management" before using any of this code.

Some parts of this repo have not been used in a very long time and it could
stand a bit of spring cleaning.

All code is available under the MIT license unless otherwise stated in the
particular file or package.


## Expectation Management

This is a personal grab-bag of utility code that I add to in a very ad-hoc
fashion. *No API stability guarantees are made*, the code is *not guaranteed
to work*, and anything may be removed at any time as I see fit.

Having said that, there are some useful things in here, some of which are
reasonably well tested, and you may get some use out of them.

I recommend you copy-paste pieces as-needed (including tests and
license/attribution) into the `internal/` folder of your projects rather than
reference these modules directly as I may change the APIs in here without
warning at any time.
