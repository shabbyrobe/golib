Go Toolbelt
===========

This is a collection of packages I use to augment the Go standard library in my
own personal projects.

I'm not sure I'd recommend using it directly; the APIs are not especially
stable. Any code I have produced myself is MIT licensed so feel free to copy
and paste it into your project.

The socketsrv library will be spun off into its own repo at some point, it's a
work in progress.

All code is available under the MIT license unless otherwise stated in the
particular file or package. There are some copy/pasted pieces of the Go
standard library in here, which retain the copyright of the Go authors and a
BSD license.
