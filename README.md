Go Toolbelt
===========

**NOTE**: experiment in flight; all top-level folders in here are independent
Go Modules.

This is a collection of code I use to augment the Go standard library in my
own personal projects.

All code is available under the MIT license unless otherwise stated in the
particular file or package.


## Expectation Management

This is a grab-bag of utility code that I add to in a very ad-hoc fashion.
No API stability guarantees are made and the code is not guaranteed to work.
Having said that, there are some extremely useful things in here that are
reasonably well tested, and you may get some use out of them.

I generally prefer to copy-paste pieces as-needed (including tests) into the
`internal/` folder of projects I'm working on.
