Docset Building Tools for Go
============================

## Expectation Management

This is a grab-bag of utility code for hacking on docsets that I add to in a
very ad-hoc fashion. *No API stability guarantees are made* and the code is
*not guaranteed to work*. Pull requests and issues will be ignored.
