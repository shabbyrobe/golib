- Could this be used for watchout's linewise protocol?
- Allow streaming long messages directly from Communicator to Proto using Reader/Writer
- Message metadata
- pub/sub
- reconnector?
- opentracing example

Tests:
- when replyto does not exist in awaiting call map
- replying to a reply... maybe this should be possible? see what happens.
- response timeout
- conn shutdown before async handler returns result
- connector shutdown should shut down all clients
- version negotiation timeouts
- websocket server timeout when client does not send heartbeat
- websocket client timeout when server does not send heartbeat
- there was a bug where replies were looking for their own ID in the calls
  map instead of the ReplyTo ID. this needs a test.
- nil handler should be guaranteed to work
- context.Context passed to HandleMessage should become Done() when service
  finishes halting, not when service starts to halt
- listener.Close() should cause Server to stop
- what actually happens when the receiver is blocked?
