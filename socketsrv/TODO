- Can version negotiation support arbitrary protocols?
- Could this be used for watchout's linewise protocol?
- Allow streaming long messages directly from Communicator to Proto using Reader/Writer
- pub/sub
- context.Context passed to HandleMessage should become Done() when service
  finishes halting, not when service starts to halt
- reconnector?

Tests:
- when replyto does not exist in awaiting call map
- replying to a reply... maybe this should be possible? see what happens.
- response timeout
- conn shutdown before async handler returns result
- connector shutdown should shut down all clients
