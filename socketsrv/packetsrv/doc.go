/*
Package packetsrv is an experiment to see if it's possible to use the machinery
of socketsrv with a PacketConn-based connection. There's probably a lot of
details that make this infeasible in practice and a lot of the benefits of the
lightweight packet connection are lost in the process. This package will be
used to experiment and find the limits of its usefulness. Please don't use it.
