Unidecode
=========

Unidecode implementation allowing operations on byte slices, in-place buffers
and strings, with full control over allocation.

Tables are built from the data in the Perl version, which is licensed under the
regrettable, FSF-rejected "Artistic License". This may be a derivative work as
a consequence, but if not, consider it MIT licensed.
