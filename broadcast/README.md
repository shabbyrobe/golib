## Expectation Management

This is part of a personal grab-bag of utility code that I add to in a very ad-hoc
fashion. *No API stability guarantees are made*, the code is *not guaranteed to work*, and
anything may be removed at any time as I see fit.

I *strongly* recommend you copy-paste pieces as-needed into the `internal/` folder of your
projects rather than reference these modules directly as I may change the APIs in here
without warning at any time.

This is provided under the MIT license. If you need me to disavow copyright I will, but
this stuff is not novel and shouldn't be bound by any. You could write the same code the
same way twice quite easily.
